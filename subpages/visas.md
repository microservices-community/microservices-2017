Permanent residents of the countries of the Schengen area are exempt from a visa
to visit Denmark. Other countries, such as United States of America or Canada,
have bilateral agreements allowing their citizens to visit Denmark without
visas. Other visitors may require a short-stay visa. For more information, visit
the <a href="http://um.dk/en/travel-and-residence/danish-visa-rules">Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of Denmark</a> website or check with a local Danish consulate
about visa requirements for your country of residence and/or nationality.
